As you step out of the wood cabin, the chill of air stings your cheeks. 
The world beyond the settlement gates is a mix of desolation and stubborn life, struggling to survive amidst ruins and overgrown vegetation. 
The sound that catches your attention isn't the usual rustle of leaves or distant animal calls; it's a voice, human and unexpected.

Walking towards the gates, you saw himâ€”a weathered old man with a tattered cloak and a cart laden with goods. His eyes, though tired, 
gleamed with a sharp intelligence that belied his age. He introduced himself as a merchant, his voice carrying a hint of gravel from years spent on the road.
<br /><br />
Then came his chilling request, delivered with a casualness that made your blood run cold.

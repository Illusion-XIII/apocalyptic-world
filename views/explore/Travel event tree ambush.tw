With each step you took, the unease grew stronger. Suddenly, a rustle in the tree to your right jolted you to a halt. You heart raced as I instinctively dropped into a defensive crouch, your eyes scanning the surroundings. That's when You saw them â€“ three men, clad in makeshift armor, emerging from behind the colossal tree.
<br /><br />
Their faces were etched with determination, and their eyes bore a hardness that spoke of survival at any cost. They carried crude weapons, each one a stark reminder of the brutality that defined this new world.
